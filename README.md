# Masters_Thesis
This repository includes the codes for the work, I have done during my Masters thesis. 
It has different modules
1 - Robust Bayesian Inference Theorem: A robust kernel Bayesian theorem to infer the posterior probabilities given prior and 
liklihood which effeciently removes the noise before making predictions using Eigen Value Decomposition.


This theorem is this validated on Zero shot classification of Food dishes (A transfer learning problem, where system make prediction
for the classes not used during training) 
2 - Features computation for all dish classes using Artificial Neural Network to be used as lilklihood in Bayesain theorem.
3 - A web scrapper to collect contextual information for food dishes to be used as prior in Bayesian theorem.
